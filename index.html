(extreme)
take a list random words (x,y,z) x = number of words y = lenght of word z = another (x,y) of words <br>
then take random numbers (x,y,z) as resiepe the number are turn into words then hashed or kept the restore static to device <br>
kernel devise ip local gate ip out (x,y,z,m,n) <br>
took random non changed static numbers added another then wrote anther then wrote <br>
then the dump are limited to time so you can restore only after this because data always change <br>
we take lenght then we make a simular after the simular we make mouse key shift able then try cracking <br>
(hard)

(meduim)
take a list random words (x,y) x = number of words y = lenght of word <br>
then take random numbers (x) as resiepe the number are turn into words then kept the restore changed to device <br>
the number took into array then generate code to unlock random array <br>
(easy)
the word took into array then generate random places to unlock use key <br>
the word change chars places if found will be needed to <br>
